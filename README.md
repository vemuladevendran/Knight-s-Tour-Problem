# Knight's Tour Problem

The Knight's Tour problem is a classic chess puzzle where the task is to find a sequence of moves for a knight on an empty chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.

## Methods Used

### 1. Backtracking Algorithm
- This method uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible moves of the knight and backtrack when reaching a dead end.
- The backtracking algorithm searches for a solution by trying different moves and undo them if they don't lead to a solution.
- It is a brute-force approach that systematically explores all possible paths until a solution is found or all paths are exhausted.

### 2. Graph Theory
- This method represents the chessboard as a graph, where each cell is a node, and legal moves between cells are edges.
- Graph traversal algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS), are used to explore the graph and find a path that covers all nodes (squares) of the chessboard exactly once.
- By treating the Knight's Tour problem as a graph traversal problem, we can leverage graph theory concepts to find a solution.

### 3. Warnsdorff's Algorithm
- Warnsdorff's algorithm is a heuristic approach that prioritizes moves based on the number of accessible neighbors (degree) from each square.
- The algorithm always selects the next move to be the one that has the fewest available moves from its destination.
- By prioritizing moves that lead to squares with fewer available moves, Warnsdorff's algorithm aims to find a solution more efficiently than pure backtracking.

## Usage
- Each method provides a Python implementation to solve the Knight's Tour problem.
- Users can choose the method that best suits their requirements based on factors such as efficiency, simplicity, and desired solution quality.

## Example
- See the provided Python scripts for implementations of the three methods.
- Run each script to find a Knight's Tour solution using the respective method.
